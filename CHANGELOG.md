# Changelog

## 1.0.4

* New feature: 'Approximate' method for modifying scales can produce rational approximations of your scale
* Improvement: Enumerate Chord method of scale generation now allows for inverted chords (e.g. 4:5:6 inverted would give 10:12:15)
* Improvement: site now automatically redirects to HTTPS on domains known to have valid HTTPS
* Bug fix: changing the main volume before pressing the first note no longer gets ignored
* Bug fix: exported TUN files now has a correct functional tuning section (https://github.com/SeanArchibald/scale-workshop/issues/82)

## 1.0.3

* New feature: generate scale from 'Enumerate chord' e.g. `4:5:6:7:8` will result in a scale containing intervals 1/1, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4, 2/1
* New feature: specify an interval in decimal format e.g. `1,5` for a perfect fifth, `2,0` for an octave.
* New feature: export your tuning as a list of Deflemask 'fine tune' effect parameters. The resulting text file is a reference you can use when manually inputting notes into Deflemask chip music tracker.
* Improvement: Colemak keyboard layout support added
* Improvement: when generating rank-2 temperaments, finding MOS scale sizes is now more efficient.
* Bug fix: error when changing main volume before audio initialised
